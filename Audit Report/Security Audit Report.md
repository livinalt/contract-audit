# Smart Contract Audit Report

**Contract Name:** StorageVictim

**Original Solidity Version:** 0.4.23

**Proposed Solidity Version:** 0.8.18

**Auditor:** [Jeremiah Samuel]


## Findings

1. **Outdated Solidity Version:** The original contract is written in Solidity version 0.4.23, which is significantly outdated. Upgrading the contract to Solidity version 0.8.18 will ensure compatibility with the latest features and improvements in the language.

2. **Syntax and Naming Conventions:** The syntax and naming conventions used in the original contract are outdated and inconsistent. Updating the contract will make the code more readable and maintainable.

3. **Explicit Data Types:** In the original contract, data types are not explicitly stated, which can lead to ambiguity and potential errors. Explicitly stating data types improves code clarity and reduces the risk of unintended behavior.

4. **Access Control and Input Validation:** Proposed changes include implementing access control mechanisms and input validation checks to enhance security. These additions help prevent unauthorized access and ensure the integrity of data stored in the contract.

5. **Function Name Clarity:** The function name `StorageVictim` conflicts with the contract name and should be renamed for clarity and to adhere to best practices.


## Proposed Fixes

1. Update the contract to Solidity version 0.8.18 to ensure compatibility with the latest language features and improvements.

2. Use consistent syntax and naming conventions throughout the contract to improve readability and maintainability.

3. Explicitly state data types for variables and function parameters to enhance code clarity and reduce the risk of errors.

4. Implement access control mechanisms and input validation checks to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the integrity of data stored in the contract.

5. Rename the function `StorageVictim` to avoid conflicts with the contract name and improve clarity.
6. Adding of withdraw function to enable store owners retrieve their money.
7. Implement account update so that every deposit would be added to previous balance.



**Lines of Code to be Corrected:**

1. **Warning (Low Severity):** `Parameter StorageVictim.store(uint256)._amount` is not in mixedCase.  
   **Code:** `function store(uint256 _amount) public payable{`  
   **Warning:** The parameter `_amount` should follow the mixedCase naming convention and be written as `amount`.

2. **Warning (Medium Severity):** `StorageVictim.owner` should be immutable.  
   **Code:** `address owner;`  
   **Warning:** Consider declaring `owner` as `immutable` to prevent it from being modified after initialization.

3. **Error (High Severity):** Data location must be "storage", "memory" or "calldata" for variable, but none was given.  
   **Code:** `Storage str;`  
   **Error:** Data location for variable `str` must be specified as `storage`, `memory`, or `calldata`.

4. **Error (High Severity):** Data location must be "storage", "memory" or "calldata" for variable, but none was given.  
   **Code:** `Storage str = storages[msg.sender];`  
   **Error:** Data location for variable `str` must be specified as `storage`, `memory`, or `calldata`.



## Conclusion:

The proposed changes and rewrite of the contract address several important security and syntax issues present in the original contract. By updating the contract to Solidity version 0.8.18( a stable version) and addressing the identified warnings and errors, have significantly improved the contract's security and reliability.

This audit report provides a clear and concise overview of the proposed changes and their impact on the contract's security and reliability. Further refinement and testing of the updated contract may be necessary to ensure its effectiveness in a production environment.
