# PROBLEM STATEMENT
The above contract is written in an older version of Solidity(0.4.x), so you need to perform 3 steps in order to complete the above assessment:

Rewrite the above contract for 0.8x without changing the logic.. Create a small audit report with your findings on the contract. You can use the tools that you learnt in the lesson.. Suggest fixes for the errors that you find in your report..
With the help of Solidity security tips and tricks, design a minimal smart contract audit report for the following contract:


## REQUIREMENTS
Your project must provide the following to be successfully completed: Functionality

*Produce a small security audit report for the above contract.
*Suggest fixes for the found errors.
*Go above and beyond the requirements by recording the functionality of the fixed contract and submit another updated report of security findings.
