this contract written in solidity version 0.4.23 obviously is quite behind.
the syntax is lot different and almost unrecogniseable by the version 0.8.24.

Though it may be stable for the compiler version, in terms of security
1. this version must be updated to give it relevance and avoid breaks 
2. sharing of same name by function na dcontract should not be allowed
Its quite important to explicitly state the data types. example is
    - uint amount = the data tyoe is not stated
3. in the store function, there needs to be a check to ensure the depositing address is checked from address(0) and anyother account that would want to siphon funds
    - the mutability of the function must be set to payable inorder to recieve ether
    - the str location must be set to either memory or storage

4. In the getStore() str location is not defined.
    - the location must be defined to either memory, storage or calldata 


    in re-writing this code we go at it like this

    contract StorageVictim{
        address owner;
        struct Storage{
            address user;
            uint256 amount
        }
    // we can use a constructor here since this function isnt doing much rather declaring a constructor which is a special function that runs once can help in giving life and purpose to the storageVicitim function
        constructor(){
            owner = msg.sender;
        }

        function store(uint256 _amount) public payable returns(Storage memory{
            require(msg.sender == storages[address], "invalid address);
            require(_amount > 0, "You cannot deposit amount less than Zero); // this helps to save user's gas
            storage[address] = storage[address] + _amount; // this would aid to keep the account updated after every storing transaction
            return storages[msg.sender];
        }

        function getOwner() external view returns(address){
            return owner;
        }


        
    }
